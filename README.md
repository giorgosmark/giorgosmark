# 👋 Hi, I'm Giorgos

## About Me

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong background in electronics, robotics, and offshore mechatronic systems. Before moving into AI/ML, I worked offshore as an ROV/Trencher Pilot and Electronic Technician, maintaining and repairing complex robotic systems under demanding conditions.

My engineering background shapes the way I approach ML problems: structured, analytical, reliability-focused, and hands-on.  
I am particularly interested in applied ML for automation, robotics, engineering systems, and real-world data.

## 🔍 I work on

- NLP (Transformers/BERT)
- Deep Learning (PyTorch)
- ML pipelines & feature engineering
- Recommender systems & clustering
- Automation and robotics-related ML
